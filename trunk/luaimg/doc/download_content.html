    <h2>Building from Source</h2>

    <div class="prose">

        <p>The source code for LuaImg lives in the Grit <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gritengine/code/2706/tree/trunk/">svn
repository</a>, and can be built by first building the lua-5.1.4 fork in the
dependencies directory, and then building LuaImg.  There are makefiles and
visual studio project files for doing this.  LuaImg depends on freeimage and
(on linux only) libreadline.  See the Grit <a
href="http://www.gritengine.com/game-engine-wiki/Compilation+Instructions">Compilation
Instructions</a> for more information, and check into the Grit <a
href="http://www.gritengine.com/chat">chat room</a> or <a
href="http://www.gritengine.com/game-engine-forum/">forums</a> if you need
help.  </p>
