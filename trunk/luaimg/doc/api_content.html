    <h2>API notation conventions</h2>

    <div class="prose">

        <p>The required types are written in the documentation, but with a few
        ingenuities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>  A <i>colour</i> can be a number, vector2, vector3, or vector4
        depending on how many channels are required (this should be clear from the
        context).</li>
            <li>Images are said to be <i>compatible</i> if they have the same size
        and number of channels, or one of them has only a single channel (a mask).  Number/vector values can be used in place of an image, in which case they act like a solid colour image.</li>
            <li>An <i>array</i> is defined to be a Lua table
        containing only number keys between 1 and some other number (without any gaps).</li>
            <li> The type of a function, when passed as a value, is denoted in the API
        documentation with an arrow, e.g., math.sqrt() would be described as
        (number)->(number).</li>
            <li>Optional parameters are given in square brackets.</li>
        </ul>
