    <div class="prose">

        <p>LuaImg is an open source commandline tool for scripted (i.e.  non-interactive) image
        manipulation.  It has been used for a variety of tasks, including detecting aurorae in
        photos, creating skins/fonts/textures for computer games, extracting alpha masks from
        blended images, experimenting with fractals, and more.  It supports a wide variety of image
        formats including animated GIFs and Direct Draw Surface (DDS).</p>

        <p>As an image programming framework, LuaImg is ideal for complex, precise, or repetitive
        tasks that are too difficult or time-consuming to do in photoshop/gimp.  It is more flexible
        than ImageMagick/Netpbm.  It is much faster than Python and even easier to use.</p>

        <p>LuaImg supports full HDR, since all images are stored in single precision floating point.
        Images are manipulated with a powerful yet high-level scripting language (based on the <a
        href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> fork from the <a
        href="http://www.gritengine.com/">Grit</a> project).  Image operations are consistent with
        layer blending modes from Gimp/Photoshop (but extended for HDR), mathematical operators are
        available, as well as convolutions, transformations, and per-pixel computations inspired by
        shader programming.  It is also possible to draw images on other images (i.e. use
        'brushes'), draw lines, and render text.</p>

        <p>LuaImg strives firstly to allow all forms of image manipulation, secondly to be easy to
        use, and finally to be fast (via the customised Lua VM).  Complex image processing
        algorithms can be expressed in a natural way through combinations of simple operations.
        Performance does not match cleverly optimised C++ code but is still good.  A 5760x3840 image
        can be processed with per-pixel scripting in a few seconds.</p>

    <h2>Language</h2>

    <div class="prose">

        <p>LuaImg is an extension of the Lua language.  The additional features provide good
        performance for computation involving compound floating point types (colours, coordinates,
        etc).  The VM supports such types as primitives, instead of heap allocated and garbage
        collected objects.</p>

        <p>These types are vector2, vector3, and vector4, the number representing the
        dimensionality.  Literal values of these types look like vec(10,20) or vec(1,2,3,4).
        Individual fields can be accessed using .x, .y, .z, or .w field accesses (the fields can be
        read but not written).  It is also possible to swizzle, e.g., .xyz will produce a vector3,
        .xz will produce a vector2, etc.</p>

        <p>Arithmetic operations on the vector types operate in a point-wise manner, e.g.
        vec(1,2,3) * vec(-1,2,1) = vec(-1,4,3).  The # operator on a vector provides its Euclidian
        length (Pythagoras).  </p>

        <p>Additionally, since most image manipulation involves math, all of the math functions have
        been made available in global scope and some of them have been lifted to operate on vector
        values (pow, ceil, floor, abs, clamp).  The unpack function will convert vectors to their
        components.  Additional functions like dot product, etc, are described in the LuaImg <a
        href='api.html'>API</a> documentation.  </p>

        <p>Finally, to facilitate text rendering, the Lua string library has been replaced by one
        that supports unicode.  The new string library is based on ICU and is backwards compatible
        with the old string library except for the regular expression syntax, which is documented <a
        href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/strings/regexp">here</a>.</p>

        <p>All the old string functions are still present, but have been prefixed with an
        underscore, except len, which has been renamed byte.  There are also two new functions,
        codepoint, which is similar to _char and returns the codepoints in the string, and
        getProperty("PROP") which fetches unicode properties by name.
