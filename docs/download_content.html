    <h2>Building from Source</h2>

    <div class="prose">

        <p>The source code for LuaImg lives in the Grit <a
        href="http://sourceforge.net/p/gritengine/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/">svn repository</a>.  Grit
        is much larger than Luaimg, as it is a full game engine with example content.  If you want
        to avoid checking out the entire repository, get the luaimg and dependencies directories
        only.  The compilation instructions for LuaImg are similar to the <a
        href="http://www.gritengine.com/game-engine-wiki/Compilation+Instructions">Grit Compilation
        Instructions</a> page, but with some differences (unless you want to build all of Grit as
        well).</p>

        <p>On windows, use the VC solution file and build the Luaimg project.  That will build all
        the necessary dependencies.</p>

        <p>On unix-based OS, the steps required are a subset of those for the Grit project.  You do
        not need to build Bullet or Ogre (or Grit).  You do still need to build ICU because of the
        text rendering support in Luaimg.  You also need to build squish, which is used for DXT
        compression (for dds export), and gif_lib.  Run make in their directories in dependencies/
        You'll need libreadline installed (on Ubuntu: libreadline-dev).  The actual Luaimg
        executable is built by running make in the luaimg dir.</p>

        <p>If you have any trouble, contact us on the Grit IRC channel or forums, see the <a
        href="http://www.gritengine.com/">Grit website</a> for details.</p>
